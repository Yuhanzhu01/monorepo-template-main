# Use Case 1

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Program Start*

**Primary Actor**: *User*

**Goal in Context**: *Start the program with a window and drawable canvas *

**Preconditions**: *NA*

**Trigger**: *user starts the program*
  
**Scenario**: *A user opens the program and there is a window and a 600x400 drawable canvas*
 
**Exceptions**: *The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system.*

**Priority**: *High-priority.*

**When available**: *First release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor communicates through I/O devices. This includes the keyboard and the mouse. The system is responsible for maintaining focus of the window when the user clicks, and should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input.*


**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *We may need to implement 'customize' function in the future, and revise this use case to prompt a user with a customized-size canvas.*
